# Micro Company - Monolithic

This version of the application is deployed as a single monolithic application.

Domain Driven Design is applied through Event Sourcing and CQRS.


## Run back-end server
The back-end server (localhost:8080) is used to serve the rest API:

- http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#/blog-controller
- http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#/project-controller


Please note that the back-end server will include front-end (angular) application that will be available on http://localhost:8080.

```bash
$ cd micro-company
$ ./mvnw clean install
$ cd micro-company/monolithic
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

## Development server for front-end (angular)

```bash
$ cd micro-company/monolithic/src/main/frontend
$ npm start
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Front-end application requires back-end application to run and serve the resources.
